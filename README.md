# Functional Reactive Programming Presentation

Created with [reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/).

## Installation/Running Locally

You need to have `grunt-cli`, and `npm` installed first.

Then run `npm install` to download the dependencies into the `node_modules` directory.

Then you should be able to run `grunt serve` and have it start the presentation up on [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/).

When developing, using something like [LiveReload](http://livereload.com/) and it's Chrome browser plugin makes development even quicker.
